1. Fallout 76 'Disconnected From Server' error

This issue appeared to be plaguing many users in the first hours of launch. As you try to log in, you will see a "Found World" notification and then you will be promptly "Disconnected From Server". The solution seems to have been to keep trying until you get in. However, this issue has been resolved on Bethesda's end for the most part.

2. Power Armor horror

Many players across all platforms are experiencing a horrifying glitch related to power armor. When some folks attempt to leave their power armor they find that they are unable to do so. Making matters worse, they appear to other players without clothes and mutated bodies. No fix has been announced at this point in time.

3. Missing enemies

On more than a few quests, we've experienced bugs where enemy locations would be marked, despite not spawning. However, upon visiting their location, there was nothing there. We've heard similar experiences from many, making quests unfinishable. Most often, we were able to resolve this by logging out and back in again.

There are widespread reports that the token dispenser in Prickett Fort is totally broken, putting a complete roadblock in the middle of a quest. There seem to be no workarounds but Bethesda states that it is working on it.

5. Ghostly gunshots

Lots of users are reporting that they are hearing gunshots near them when there is no one around. I have actually experienced this myself and it can really spook you out when you think you are alone and start hearing gunfire. Bethesda has stated that they are aware of the issue and will be fixing it in a patch soon.
